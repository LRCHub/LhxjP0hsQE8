[00:15.44] Whoa, oh-oh
[00:18.74] Well, well, well, well, well
[00:23.14] Oh, oh
[00:26.14] 
[00:29.34] Someone to count on
[00:31.18] In a world ever changing
[00:34.04] Here I am, stop where you're standing
[00:36.81] What you need is a lover, a man to take over
[00:40.77] Oh, girl, huh, don't look any further
[00:59.27] 
[01:00.02] Strange
[01:01.32] When you think of the chances
[01:03.44] That we'd both be in a state of mind
[01:07.06] Too cool to be careless
[01:08.87] Think about the right thing
[01:10.99] Oh, baby, don't look any further
[01:26.99] 
[01:15.68] Tonight, we're gonna taste a little paradise
[01:20.92] Rock me all night long
[01:22.92] Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
[01:27.48] And we'll go on and on and on and on
[01:45.48] 
[02:00.68] Someone to count on (mm-mm)
[02:06.60] What you need is a lover to love you all over
[02:10.80] Oh, baby
[02:12.36] Don't you look any further, further, oh
[02:31.86] 
[02:36.23] Ooh-ooh, ooh
[02:40.26] Don't you, don't you
[02:41.23] Don't you, don't you
[02:42.25] Don't you look any further
[02:55.25] 
[02:45.35] Tonight, we're gonna taste a little paradise
[02:50.68] Oh, won't you rock me all night long?
[02:52.97] Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
[02:57.46] And we'll go on and on and on and on
[03:03.67] On and on and on and on
[03:15.17] 
[03:15.26] Day-o umba day-o
[03:16.82] Mombajee ai-oh, oh, oh, oh
[03:29.82] 
[03:23.01] Someone to count on (mm-hmm, yeah)
[03:29.15] What you need is a lover to love you all over
[03:33.54] Oh, baby
[03:34.88] Don't you look any further, further
